'''Generalized Linear Models in Python

glimpy is a Python module for fitting generalized linear models. It 
aims to follow the scikit-learn API closely enough to improve ease of 
use and to take advantage of useful scikit-learn tools such as 
`sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` and `sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`.
